# Context
- On generation side, prediction from renewables is less predictable
- Customers installing their own generation and using batteries
- Octopus has time series data of usage from smart meters
- 77K smart meters

# How Octopus approaches time series forecasting
- Lots of different approaches to time series forecasting, each from different communities
- TSF (Time series forecasting)
- Is it a regression problem? Yes, so can use scikit learn
- latent variables?
- octopus uses deep learning route as this scaled quite well
- they open sourced some code https://github.com/octoenergy/timeserio
