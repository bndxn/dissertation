# An Introduction to Deep Generative Modelling [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.05180.pdf). 

## Abstract: 

* DGMs have many hidden layers, high-dimensional probability estimates
* Challenges: hard to design and train, challenging to find out why a model is effective
* Three main approaches: normalizing flows (NF), variational autoencoders (VAE), and generative adversarial networks (GAN)
* There are links between generative modelling and optimal transport

## Challenges

* 1: DGM Tis ill-posed because impossible to uniquely identify a probability distribution from finite samples
* 2: Training requires knowing how similar samples are to the true distribution
* 3: Training usually assumes the distribution is related to a Gaussian, but determining this is impossible
